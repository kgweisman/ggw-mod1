      <h1 id='title-text'>Mind Survey</h1>
      
      <p class="block-text"> No one really knows what it is like to be a chimp or a robot, but we humans do have some ideas about what other minds are like. This survey asks for you to think about and compare different kinds of minds.</p>

      <p class="block-text">First, you'll meet the characters—a chimp, a robot, a baby, a dog, and other characters who may have minds.</p>

      <p class="block-text"> Next, you'll pick a survey. Each 10-minute survey is about a mental ability—such as the ability to feel joy, to think, or to feel pain. Your job is to judge pairs of characters to say if one has more of the ability.</p>

      <p class="block-text"> We ask you to do each survey only once and without interruption. At the end, you'll learn how you ranked all the characters and how your rankings compare with others we've collected. Then, choose another survey or come back another time!</p>

      <p class="fun-text">Click the "Next" button to meet the cast of characters!</p>
